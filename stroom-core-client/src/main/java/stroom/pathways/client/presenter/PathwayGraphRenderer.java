 * it, one ring per level.
 *
 * <p>Says two things the tree cannot. How large a node is drawn is how much has gone through it, so a
 * node one trace reaches forty times stands out from one it reaches once. What colour it is drawn is
 * when it last changed, so the parts of the model still being learnt can be told at a glance from the
 * parts that settled long ago.
 *
 * <p>Edges are drawn in SVG behind markers drawn in HTML, the way the tree draws its curves, so the
 * element a click lands on is an HTML one — selecting puts a class on it, and that does not work on an
 * SVG element.
