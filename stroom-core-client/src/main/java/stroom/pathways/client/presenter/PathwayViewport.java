/**
 * How a drawing is looked at: how far it is scaled, where it is scrolled to, and moving it by hand.
 *
 * <p>Kept apart from what is drawn because the two have nothing to say to each other, and because
 * holding them together hid the ways they interfere. Scaling has to happen before the scroll is put
 * back, or the scroll lands outside a box that has not grown yet; putting the scroll back has to be
 * told apart from centring, or the two fight; and both have to wait for the browser to lay the
 * drawing out, which it does after the turn the drawing was made in. None of that was said anywhere
 * — it was a property of the order some lines happened to be written in.
 *
 * <p>Nothing here knows what a pathway is. It is told when a drawing is about to be replaced and when
 * it has been, and it is handed a way of finding the thing to centre on.
