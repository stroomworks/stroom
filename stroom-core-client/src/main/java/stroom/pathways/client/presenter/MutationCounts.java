/**
 * How much each node of a pathway had changed by a point in its history.
 *
 * <p>Four rules, kept here so that everything showing a count says the same thing by the same
 * measure:
 *
 * <ul>
 *     <li><b>Traces, not changes.</b> A trace that widened nine constraints of a node taught it one
 *     thing on one occasion, the same as a trace that widened one.</li>
 *     <li><b>Coming into being is not changing.</b> A node just learnt has changed no times, however
 *     much was learnt about it. This covers the whole of the trace that first took the route, not
 *     just the parts of it that added something: a first trace that sets a duration and then widens
 *     it taught the model what it knows rather than changing its mind. That is how a pathway's own
 *     Times Updated counts, which does not move for the trace that created the pathway.</li>
 *     <li><b>A node a trace did not carry was not changed by it.</b> Its occurrences widen to admit
 *     none, which is a real change to the model, but no trace reached the node — counting it would
 *     say a node had been changed more often than it had been used.</li>
 *     <li><b>The point being looked at is honoured.</b> Winding a model back and then counting
 *     changes it had not yet been through says something that was never true.</li>
 * </ul>
