 * What a drawing's own buttons can ask for.
 *
 * <p>A drawing puts its controls in its markup and says what a click on one means; the view around it
 * carries the request out. Without this the view had to know the id of every button a particular
 * drawing happens to have, and what each of them does — so adding a drawing meant editing the view.
