/**
 * One path through the model, with how many traces took it.
 *
 * <p>What the trace did is one shape, {@code root}, holding the whole walk: every node reached, the
 * children run at each, and the order they ran in, with work that repeated said once. How many times
 * a repeat ran is not part of it, because how much work there was to do is the workload rather than
 * the path through the code. Two traces whose shapes are the same took the same path and share a
 * row.
 *
 * <p>The id of the trace that created the row is kept so the screen can open one that took the
 * path. It stays put as the count rises rather than moving to the newest, so the row points at a
 * trace someone can have looked at — at the cost of being the one most likely to have aged out of
 * the trace store.
