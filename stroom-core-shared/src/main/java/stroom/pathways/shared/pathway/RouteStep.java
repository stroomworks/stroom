/**
 * One shape a route takes at a point: a node and the children it ran there in the sequence it ran
 * them, a run of work that did not finish, or several runs that happened at the same time.
 *
 * <p>{@code node} indexes the node list on {@link Routes}, except for these:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>{@link #UNFINISHED} — a run of work one turn of which stopped part way through; its steps are
 *   the one turn that was repeated.
 *   <li>{@link #CONCURRENT} — work that happened at the same time on more than one thread; its steps
 *   are the runs, each a {@link #RUN}. They are held in an order settled by what they are rather than
 *   by which thread got there first, because that is the scheduler's doing and not the path through
 *   the code — two traces that ran the same work on four threads took the same route however the
 *   threads happened to be timed. One run does not mean one thread: runs that came to the same thing
 *   are said once, and turns of a single node taken between several threads are said as one run,
 *   because which thread took which turn is decided by what it reached first.
 *   <li>{@link #RUN} — one of those runs; its steps are what that thread did, in the order it did it.
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>Work that repeated and did finish is simply said once, with nothing to mark that it happened
 * more than once — how much work there was to do is the workload rather than the path through the
 * code, and a trace that handled one document would otherwise be a different route from one that
 * handled three.
 *
 * <p>Steps index the shape list on {@link Routes}, which holds each distinct shape once, so a subtree
 * that many routes share costs one entry however many of them reach it. A shape with no steps is a
 * node that ran nothing, and that is the only thing it can mean.
