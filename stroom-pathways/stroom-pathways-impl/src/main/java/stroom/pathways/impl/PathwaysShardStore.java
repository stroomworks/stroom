/**
 * Lends out one shard of a Pathways document's learnt model, as a local copy.
 *
 * <p>The authoritative copy lives on the shared filesystem and is never opened there — no LMDB
 * environment is ever opened on the shared mount, which is an invariant of the whole shared file
 * store. So a caller is handed a throwaway local directory, works in that, and the finished file is
 * copied back up.
 *
 * <p><b>Call only while holding the shard's cluster lock.</b> That lock is the whole of the mutual
 * exclusion: the push does not check that the shared copy is still the one it handed down, so it
 * would overwrite whatever is there. In normal running that cannot bite, because the lock is taken
 * by a conditional update of one database row and so admits one holder at a time, on one node or
 * across all of them. The one case it does not cover is a lease that expires while its holder still
 * believes it holds the lock — then two processes can both be in here, and the later push discards
 * the earlier one's work silently. Plan B's own two shared-store write paths have the same exposure,
 * and it is accepted here for the same reason: a hold bounded to seconds against a lease measured in
 * minutes makes it rare.
