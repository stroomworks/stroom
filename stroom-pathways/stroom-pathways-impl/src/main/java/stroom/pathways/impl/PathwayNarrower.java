/**
 * Holds each model to what it has been given lately.
 *
 * <p>A trace only ever widens a model, so an envelope left to itself ends up admitting everything and
 * saying nothing — and a change stops meaning anything, because nothing falls outside it any more.
 * Once a night every model is narrowed back to what has actually been seen within its document's
 * observation window, from the day by day account kept beside it as traces were applied.
 *
 * <p>What that restores is the worth of a change. After a narrowing, a constraint widening
 * says something happened that has not happened in the window — which is the thing worth being told
 * about, and what an envelope that only grows can never say.
