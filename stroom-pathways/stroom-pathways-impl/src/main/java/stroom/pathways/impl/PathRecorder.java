/**
 * Folds one trace's walk into the paths a pathway has already seen.
 *
 * <p>A path is one shape holding the whole walk: every node the trace reached, the children it ran
 * at each, and the order it ran them in, with work that repeated said once. How many times a repeat
 * ran is not part of it — recording that makes a trace that called a routine eight times a different
 * path from one that called it seven, which is the workload rather than the code path.
 *
 * <p>Shapes are kept once each and named by position, so a subtree many paths reach costs one entry
 * however many of them reach it, and a path is one number.
 *
 * <p>Every trace produces a path, including a trace that reached no children at all, so the path
 * counts sum to the number of traces the pathway has been used for.
