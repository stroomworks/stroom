/**
 * Writes a {@link QueueItem} — the spans, roots and lookup tables of a set of traces, copied out of a
 * trace store into an environment of their own.
 *
 * <p>The environment is built on local disk and only its finished {@code data.mdb} is copied to the
 * shared store, because no LMDB environment is ever opened on the shared mount — an invariant of the
 * whole shared file store, and the reason every other path here copies down, works locally and pushes
 * back. Opening one there would put LMDB's memory-mapped writes and its {@code lock.mdb} on a mount
 * that may not support either.
 *
 * <p>The copy lands under a temporary name and is renamed into place as the last thing that happens,
 * so a consumer never sees a part-written item and a producer that dies mid-write leaves only a
 * temporary directory behind.
